Design a Staging Website and Make it Responsive Using Frontend Skills

Description:

I used HTML to structure the full staging website with clean and semantic code.
I applied Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive, and utility-first styling.
I implemented JavaScript to add interactivity, like sliders and responsive menu toggles.
I made sure the website is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
I also added smooth animations and hover effects to enhance the user experience.
